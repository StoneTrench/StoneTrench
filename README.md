In English
The * symbol while chatting usually means a corretion if used once before a word.
It is needed because after a piece of text has been written, sent, and read by a person,
you cannot go back in time to correct the mistake.
```
> Goo morning!
> *Good
```
In the newest update, you can use the * symbol in a sentence that does not correct a previous mistake.
The word that has the * symbol after it can be corrected by another person if it was misspelled, used incorrectly or means a different thing than you're referring to.
```
> I bought spoons*
> Those are sporks
```
It can also mean the person who's writing it is unsure if he's using the right word.
